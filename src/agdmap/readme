Agdmap is a technology mapping algorithm with adaptive gate decomposition [1].
It is a cut enumeration based mapping algorithm with bin packing for
simultaneous wide gate decompostion, which is a patent pending technology.
The source code is provided here for research and evaluation purpose.
For commercial usage, please contact Prof. Chang Wu at wuchang@fudan.edu.cn.
